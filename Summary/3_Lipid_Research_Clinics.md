## Summary

Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the major casue of death adn disability in the United States. Plasma total and LDL-C levels may be reduced by diets and drugs.. However, before such treatment can be advocated, it is desirable to show that reducing cholesterol levels safely reduces the risk of CHD in people. Many clinical trials of cholesterol lowering have been conducted, but their results, although often encouraging, have been inconclusive. In this paper, they reported the results of The Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial. The LRC-CPPT findings show that reducing total cholesterol by lowering LDL-C levels can diminish the incidence of CHD morbidity and mortality in men at high risk for CHD because of raised LDL-C levels. This clinical trial provides strong evidence for a causal role for these lipids in the pathogenesis of CHD. 

## Reaction

This is the second clinical trails paper I read. The deign of the clinical trail seems make sense. And there seems to be a lot of evidence to support their main conconlusion:reducing total cholesterol by lowering LDL-C levels can diminish the incidence of CHD morbidity and mortality in men at high risk for CHD because of raised LDL-C levels. Overall it is a good paper. But I am unsure about whether the content is rigourous enough in nowadays's view.

## Questions for discussion

1. Are there ethical concerns for clinical trails especiilay for the people in control group? 
2. What is the standard format and reuqired content for a clinical trail paper? Are there any differnce of the format between 1984 and now?

## Notes

1. If we also want to study women, The additional sample to include depends on the prevelance on women,
2. Should also give people other drungs in control group.
3. People who adhere to the treatment tend to be healthier.
