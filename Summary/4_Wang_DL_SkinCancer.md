## Summary

There are few patient dataâ€“driven tools exist for more accurate predictio nfor new-onset nonmelanoma skin cancer, which could enhance prevention measures. Wang et al. developed a deep learning based prediction model for incident nonmelanoma skin cancer based on large-scale, multidimensional, nonimaging medical information. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the model was 0.89; several potential determining factors for prediction such as history of precancerous lesions and use of some photosensitizing medications were also identified. This algorithm can accurately identify individuals at high risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer and may help to optimize prevention interventions and adherence.

## Reaction

At the first glance I saw this paper, I thought of a paper published in Science about the racial bias in health algorithms([Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aax2342)). Then I checked the sample they used and it is all Asian. However, it is good that the auothors indeed acknowledge the limited ethnicity of the study population as a critical limitation for the study. Another thought is how many prediction accuracy can we gain if we use the genetic data. Since I am doing genetic research and the feature they used to do the prediction is independent of the genetics, I think there should be some gain if adding genetics into the algorithm.
## Questions for discussion

1. When will people be able to deploy such algorithms into clinical practice? 
2. How many prediction accuracy can we gain if we use the genetic data?
