# 07_1983_PropensityScore


## Summary

This paper developed the propensity score, the  conditional  probability  of  assignment  to  a  particular
treatment  given  a  vector  of observed  covariate.  It also estalished theory to show that adjust for propensity  score is sufficient  to remove  bias due  to
all  observed  covariates.The propensity score has many applications including matching, multivariate
adjustment  by  subclassification, and visualization of multivariate covariance adjustment by a two-dimensional  plot.

## Reaction

I still remembered the moment I saw this concept when I took the causal inference class. It is a really smart quantity and make total sense to me. It makes matching to be one of the standard approach in causal inference and many new methods are based on this propensity score. However, there are some limitations of the propensity score such as the bias due to unobserved covaraites. Then I came across another measure I really lovecalled E-value introduced by Tyler J VanderWeele and Ding Peng, which evidence for causality in observational studies that are potentially subject to confounding. I would say these two measure are both very elagant and already became standard in causal inference.

## Questions for discussion

1. Are there other limitations of propensity score?
2. Why didn't they win Nobel prize on propensity score given Nobel prize was gaven by causal inference this year?
