# 6_Berry_1998_Mammography


## Summary

Existing studies do not adequately address some important issues about whether or not recommend regular mammography to women aged 40–49 years. Berry provided new analyses and evaluations of the evidence in this paper. On one hand, This paper first present a metaanalysis of the randomized trials that allows for differences between the trials and that addresses an individual woman’s decision more appropriately than do the existing analyses. On the other hand, this paper provide ways of presenting the benefits and risks of mammography that will help women and their caregivers in making screening decisions.

## Reaction

I think this is a good paper from several points. First of all, it uses the convincing statistical analysis to address the important question that whether or not recommend regular mammography to women aged 40–49 years. Second, it also discussed the potential factors that will impact the conclusions they made in the paper. Thirdly, it also provide ways of presenting the benefits and risks of mammography that will help women and their caregivers in making screening decisions. This can really help people made their own decisions based on the risk and benefits.

I also love Berry's repsonse to the commentary. It made some clarfications and point out the logic errors for the commentary.


## Questions for discussion

1. Are people still doing Screening Mammography now? Are there more advanced approach?
2. I believe genetics(BRCA gene) is one of key risk factor for breast cancere? Is Screening Mammography complementary to the genetics testing?
