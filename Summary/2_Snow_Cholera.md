# Snow_1885_OnTheModeOfCommunicationOfCholera


## Summary

People thought cholera was spread by effluvia given off from the patient into the surrounding air if it was a communicable disease. In this paper, Snow argued that cholera invariably commences with the affection of the alimentary canal and was spreaded by contaminated water. He first used the patient symptoms to support his arugements. Next, he investigated the the distribution of cholera cases and used a dot map to illustrate how cholera cases is concentrated near the public water pump on Broad Street. Last, he also used the difference for the prevalnce of cholera the areas supplied by different water companies to support his argument. 
## Reaction

I think this is an very important study in the history of epideimoloigy. The map delivered the key messgae that Snow want to deliver very well: cholera was spreaded by contaminated water. As far as I am concerned, it is a really hard study. Snow interviewed so many person and collects all kinds of different information. His main supporting evidence: cholera cases is concentrated near the public water pump on Broad Street is a statistical enrichement test for me. He investigated whether there are enrichment of cholera cases for the people who was in contact with the polluted water in water pump. It is a very nice study.
## Questions for discussion

1. Did this paper have a big impact as soon as it was published? If not, why?
2. I wonder how did people determine spread ways of a disease in morden days? Take covid for an example, how did people determine that it can spread in air?
