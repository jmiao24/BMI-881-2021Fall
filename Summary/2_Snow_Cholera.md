# Snow_1885_OnTheModeOfCommunicationOfCholera


## Summary

People thought cholera was spread by effluvia given off from the patient into the surrounding air if it was a communicable disease. In this paper, Snow argued that cholera invariably commences with the affection of the alimentary canal and was spread by contaminated water. He first used the patient's symptoms to support his arguments. Next, he investigated the distribution of cholera cases and used a dot map to illustrate how cholera cases are concentrated near the public water pump on Broad Street. Last, he also used the difference for the prevalence of cholera in the areas supplied by different water companies to support his argument.

## Reaction

I think this is a very important study in the history of epidemiology. The map delivered the key message that Snow wanted to deliver very well: cholera was spread by contaminated water. As far as I am concerned, it is a really hard study. Snow interviewed so many people and collected all kinds of different information. His main supporting evidence: cholera cases are concentrated near the public water pump on Broad Street is a statistical enrichment test for me. He investigated whether there are enrichment of cholera cases for the people who were in contact with the polluted water in the water pump. It is a very nice study.

## Questions for discussion

1. Did this paper have a big impact as soon as it was published? If not, why?
2. I wonder how people determine the ways of spreading a disease in modern days? Take covid for an example, how did people determine that it can spread in air?
