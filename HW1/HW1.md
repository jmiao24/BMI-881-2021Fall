## My design choices.
1. I use the log transformation to make sure the mortality rate are on the same scale.
2. I use different color for different age group to show there are difference of mortality rate in differnt group.
3. I use different panel to represents the different income group. I ordered the income group into high -> all -> low and middle to make sure the pattern of the line from left to right is monotone. I added "income group: " in the panel title to make sure people understand what each panel represents.

## How to make a comprehensive graph that includes all of the information in the table

I will plot many figures for rate of every responese variable (such as Incidence).
