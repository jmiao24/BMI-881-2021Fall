# 06_Bootstrap

This paper mainly applied the bootstrap to regression residuals to estiamte the standard errors for the regression coefficient. They applied it to econometric equation describing the demand for energy by industry and compare the empirical standard errors to the conventional asymptotic standard errors. The results shows that the conventional SE is too optimistic. Some mathematical detail to explain this phenomenon is also provided by the paper.


I never used bootstrap but often used jacknife in my research. My undestanding of the bootstrap is to estimate the SE by resampleing the sample. It is interesting to know that we can apply bootstrap to  to regression residuals. 

## Questions for discussion

1. What is the limitation of bootstrapping?
2. What is the difference between bootstapping and jacknife.
