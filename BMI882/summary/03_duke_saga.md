## Summary

This paper examine several paper published by Dr. Potti purporting to use microarray-based signatures of drug sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response. It points out the many mistakes in the original analysis like reversed or incorrect labels and duplicated samples. It concluded these mistakes results from poor documentation for data processing thus lack of reproducibility. It calls for better documentation and tools to increase the reproducibility of research.

## Reaction

The problems descibed in the paper is very important. I think we need to be very careful when doing data processing and analysis, make good documentation. And if we did not mean on purpose but finally have the similar problem like what Dr. Potti met, we need to retract the paper immediately. 

## Questions for discussion

1. How to bette identify the mistakes in our data processing?
2. What should we do if we found other's analysis is wrong?

## Lessons
1. Know the common mistakes and think about how to find them.
