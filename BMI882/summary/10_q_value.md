# 10_q-value

In this paper, Dr. John Storey introduce q-value,  an analogy to pvalue, to measure significance in termsof the false discovery rate. Besides, this paper also provides a way to estimate pFDR and q-value using empirical Bayes approach given a pre-specficed rejection region. 

I love this paper very much. I also look into another paper called "THE POSITIVE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE: A BAYESIAN INTERPRETATION AND THE q-VALUE" about pFDR written John Storey. It is one of the clearest written statistics paper I have ever read. 

## Questions for discussion

1. What is the limitation of q-value?
1. What field does people commonly use q-value?
