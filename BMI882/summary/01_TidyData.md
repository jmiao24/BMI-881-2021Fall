# 01_Wickham_2014_tidy-data


## Summary

The process of cleaning and preparing the data always took much of the time for the data analysis. There is little reseach on how to make data cleanin an preparing more effcient and easy. To address this problem, Wickham deveoped "tidy data", which contains the principle to clean, prepare and store the data, R packages to make the principle easy to follow. It also provides many concrete examples to show what is the principle and how to follow it.

## Reaction

Wickham won the COPSS award due to his contribution in R software includin ggplot2, this tidy data and etc. There were a lot of discussions about whether it is proper to give one of the best award in the stat field to a "software engineer". From my perspective, it is a really a good ability to summaize the experience into principles. When we met some problems he descibed in the paper, we might think of a good way to deal with it and let it becomes our habit. However, write it down and let what people know what you thoughts is right is very difficult. I did not use tidy data very often. The functions in the Package can be replaced by some common default function in R. But my experience is that if you are very familar, the codes would be much more readable if using tidy data rather than using the default function. I would like to use it more in the future.

## Questions for discussion

1. How to make tidy data more popular or even as the gold standard in stat software?
2. What is the best way to learn tidy data?
