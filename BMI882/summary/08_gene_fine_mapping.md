# 08_gene_fine_mapping

Back in 19050s, people did not know the differentce between gene and DNA. In the first paper, Benzer designed a recombination experiment to test whether there is a. He further used "pseudo-allelis" test to show that rII region can be divided into functionally distinguishable segments. In the second paper,  Benzer further demonstated the linear sturtuce of DNA.

This is a pioneering paper. But I am surprised they are only cited for 747 and 582 times. Besides, I am also suprised by Dr. Benzer scientific path. It seems he has very big contribution in physics and biology.

## Questions for discussion

1. I am curios how did Benzer have such hypothesis in mind and design the experiment.
