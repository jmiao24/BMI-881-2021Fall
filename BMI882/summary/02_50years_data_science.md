## Summary

This paper reviews the data science for more than 50 years since the publication of “The Future of Data Analysis” in 1962. The author first discuss the relationship between statistics and data science, what does it mean by "Big data" and "skills" required, and "jobs" provided by data science. Then the author reviewed several realted paper to give a better overview for data science.

## Reaction

I like this paper very much. It tells me the history and background for data science.  One interesting points is the relationship between statistics and data science. From my view, currently, what statistics research typically do is to first build a screwdriver (methods) and then find a proper screw (data) to demonstrates the hammer works, what data science research do is typically first know what the screw(data and problem) looks like and try to find a proper screwdriver for it. This leads to a gap between the current stage between  statistics research and data science research. It would be good if the statistics focus more on application and the data science research cares more about the property of the methods used.

## Questions for discussion

1. Does the data science sound a better name than statistics given the statistics department seems want to change the name?
2. How to better teach data science in school?
