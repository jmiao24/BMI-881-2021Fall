## Summary

This paper talks about what information should be requierd when publishing a clinical "omnics" publications. It mainly consider five things that should be supplied: 1) raw data 2) the code used to derive the results from the raw data 3) evidence of the provenance of the raw data so that labels could be checked 4) written descriptions of any nonscriptable analysis steps and 5)prespecified analysis plans, if any. It also discussed the rational of requiring these data, and tools to make it easier.

## Reaction

I think the five things that should be supplied mentioned in the paper make sense. However, it may to difficult to realize in practice. For example, the raw data always is restricted due to privacy concern in "omics" field. Thus, even with th code, we cannot replicate the results. However, I found that more and more people are "open-source" now and release their analysis and simulation codes. 

## Questions for discussion

1. Suppose we thought found a "mistake" in a big paper, what should we do?
2. Should the journal or conference require releasing the code if people want to publish a paper?
