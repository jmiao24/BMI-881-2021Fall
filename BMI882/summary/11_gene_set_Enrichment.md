# 11_gene_set_enrichment

These two paper mainly introduced a method called Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).  Rather than focused on individual genes, it was designed to detect modest but coordinate changes in the expression of groups of functionally related genes.  They used this method to find that PGC-1Î±-responsive genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are coordinately downregulated in human diabetes. 

## Questions for discussion

1. It seems this method highly depends on the functional annotation of the gene. How did people commonly assign the function to a gene?
2. What is the difference between GSEA and heritablity enrichement analysis?
