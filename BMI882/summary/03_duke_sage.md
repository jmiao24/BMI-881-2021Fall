# 01_Gelman_2002_TurningTablesIntoGraphs


## Summary

Statistician recommend using graph to deliver message, but often does not follow it, potentially due to the heavy workload to make nice graphs.  Gelman et al. provided a “proof of concept” that statistical papers can benefit by changing tables into graphs. They revisited  a single issue of JASA and shows that how all numerical displays can be shown graphically, including inferences such as estimated regression coefficients and statistical research results such as frequency evaluations that are typically displayed in tabular form.  They invoked the statistician begin to think more seriously about displaying their results as comparisons.

## Reaction

I think this is a good paper to convince statisticians that in many cases, graphs can do a better job than tables. They did not chant the slogan that statisticians should use graphs, but provided many concrete examples, converting tables into graphs, and allowing readers to judge which format is more readable.Most of the graph they made looks pretty good to me. One exception for me is Figure5, I also spent a hard time in understanding the graph while the table looks more readable for me. One potential reason is that people always present the asymptotic characteristics of a statistical method in the table, such as type I errors. Therefore, due to past experience, I have read such a table many times, but for the first time I have seen people present such results in a graph. Nevertheless, all in all, this is a meaningful paper that can improve the readability of future statistical papers.

## Questions for discussion

1. Is this still a problem for theoretical journal like JASA?
2. Whether we should replace all our tables into graph? If not, what kind of table shouldn't we replace?
3. Are there improvements for the Figures in the paper?
