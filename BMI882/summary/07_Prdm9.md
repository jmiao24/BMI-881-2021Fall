Genetic recombination during meoisis is one of the key mechnisms to increase genetic diversity in organisms. Recombination hotspots are regions in the geonome that exhibit elevated rates of recombination relative to a neutral expectation. However, such hotspots are different between humans and chimpanzees given their 99% aligned bases. These paper showed that PRDM9 protein is responsible for creating Recombination hotspots and lead to the difference.

I think these are very important paper. But one question from me as a biostatistics student is how do they have such hypothisis. Did they used any data science methods to generate the hypothisis? 

## Questions for discussion

1. How to generate the hypothesis in genetics?
