Genetic recombination during meoisis is one of the key mechnisms to increase genetic diversity in organisms. Recombination hotspots are regions in the geonome that exhibit elevated rates of recombination relative to a neutral expectation. However, such hotspots are different between humans and chimpanzees given their 99% aligned bases. These paper showed that PRDM9 protein is responsible for creating Recombination hotspots and lead to the difference.

I think these are very important paper. And this is a textbook example of using data science to motivate the follow-up experiment for genetics. However, I hardly seen any gene findings in GWAS and its follow-up analysis. GWAS found so many SNPs and the problems become even harder if we want to macth SNP with causal gene.

## Questions for discussion

1. I think overall the statistics is not very difficult but why people never found PRDM9 before this paper? It is because the data used in the paper is hard to obtain?
2. How to generate the hypothesis in genetics?
