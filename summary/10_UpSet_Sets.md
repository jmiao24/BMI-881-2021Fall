# 10_UpSet

## Summary

This paper provides a novel visualization technique for the quantitative
analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries, which enable analysts to investigate the interactions between sets with respect to their size,  the contained elements and their associated attributes. Upset is web-based and open source.


## Reaction

I like this tool a lot. I used it in my first paper and it is moer clear than some traditional approach like venn plot. The only complain about it is that I saw some very compliecated Upset plot. It is very difficult to see what is the most important message in the plot. However, we should focus more on how to improve the visualization of our data and results.


## Questions for discussion
1. Is there any improvement for Upset plot?

## Take away from discussion
1. The challanges of the data vislization the same as the challanges of other aspects.
