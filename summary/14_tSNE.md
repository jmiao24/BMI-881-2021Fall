## Summary
This paper propose a new method to visualize high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. It extends the Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) to t-SNE in two perspective: 1. It uses the t-distibution to replace the Gaussian to calculate similarity in low-dimensional space. 2. It use a simpler gradients for a symmetrized cost function. The author used several data sets and showed the results t-SNE are significantly better than other approaches.

## Reaction
I have seen a lot of papers using this methods. But I

1. What the advantages and disadvantages between t-SNE, UMAP and PCA?
