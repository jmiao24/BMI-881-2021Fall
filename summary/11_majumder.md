## Summary

The graphics in statistical field plays an important role in visualization of data and providing the intuition of the results. However, it is difficult to measuring the strength of patterns seen in plots and do statistical inference for it. In this paper, they introduced the visual statistical inference. They use the the application of visual inference to linear models to show that this new tool performs comparably with the conventional tests, and expectedly outperforms them when data are contaminated. 

## Reaction

First, I am little confused about the input for the visual statistical inference. In the paper, they stated that "Ideally, thevisual test statisticis deÔ¨Åned and constructed using the grammar of graphics". However, I am not sure how they can use the grammar of graphics to constrcuct the test statisticis. Second, their idea seems novel to me, but the usage of their method seems limited. I don't think people would buy this method when they only take  graphic as input but not the raw data.


## Questions for discussion


1. How they can use the grammar of graphics to constrcuct the test statisticis?
2. What kind of situation would people apply this method?
3. Can they use computer vision to really use the figure as input for their method?

## Take away from discussion
1. Fisher's claim is that t-test statistics is like the test statistics for permutation test.
