## Summary

This paper provides an overview of graphical causal inference. It first contrasts causal analysis with standard statistical analysis to help one understand what causal inference is. Second, it proposes a unified theory, called "structural," in which most, if not all, aspects of causality can be formulated, analyzed, and compared. Third, it presents a set of simple and effective tools, spawned by structural theory, for solving a wide variety of causal problems. Finally, it shows how previous approaches to causal analysis have emerged as special cases of general structural theory.


## Reaction

I like this paper. It provides an clear overview of the graphical causal inference. It tells people how to use graph to think about causal inference. The things I like most is at the beginning of "3. Structural models, diagrams, causal eï¬€ects, and counterfactuals". It gives us the gold standard to the theory for causal inference. But it might not be easy to achieve.

## Questions for discussion

1. It seems the graphical causal inference requires knowing the true graph structure, but how can we get it?
2. I am under the impression that Judea Pearl's causal inference is of different factions with Donald Rubin's. What is exactly the difference?

## Take away
1. We cannot infer the joint distibution of serveral r.v only with the data; i.e. the causal relationship
2. The biggest contribution is that if we know the true graph (like what people thought which variables to include when including the propensity score), we can infer the causal relationship.
