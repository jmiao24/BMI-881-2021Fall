## Summary
The Manubot paper introduce a software named Manubot to address the challenges of open scholarly writing. With Manubot, manuscripts are written in Markdown and stored in a Git repository to accurately track changes over time.  And the deep review paper is collaboratively written on GitHub using a tool called Manubot. It mainly examined applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. 


## Reaction

I like the idea of Manubot. I would definitly try it out when there is chances. I looked throght the Github repository for deep review and found it complicated. I am wondering what kind of people would give up their current tool to write manuscript such as word and switch to Manubot. I also think it is not very easy to get familar with Manubot and convince the collborator to use it too.


## Questions for discussion

1. What kind of people would give up their current tool to write manuscript such as word and switch to Manubot?
2. What is unique feature of Manubot to make people use it?
