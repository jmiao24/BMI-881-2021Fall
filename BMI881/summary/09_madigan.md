## Summary

Clinical studies that use observational databases of the same issue in different databases can and do generate different results, sometimes with strikingly different clinical implications. In this paper, the authors systematically study heterogeneity among databases, holding other study methods constant, by exploring relative risk estimates for 53 drugoutcome pairs and 2 widely used study designs across 10 observational databases. They found inconsistency for both direction and statistical significance across different databases where the analysis was conducted on .They concluded that clinical studies that use observational databases can be sensitive to the choice of database. 



## Reaction

I am not surprised by their conclusion. There are multiple factors that will cause this database heterogeneity such as the participation bias, sex bias, age bias, and uncontroled confounding. These kind of heterogeneity motivates us to do the meta-anlysis and replication analysis in order to make the conclusion to be robust. And such paper can always remind people to do such analtsis. Another observation is that the table in the paper is not good at all. The table in the supplment is also not easy to read. Perhaps excel is better in this case.

## Questions for discussion


1. How to address such database heterogeneity problem? Meta-analysis?
2. If there exists database heterogeneity problem, how to draw the "right" conclusion?
