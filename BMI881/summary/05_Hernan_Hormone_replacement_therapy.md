## Summary
The Women's Health Initiative randomized trial found that women receiving estrogen/progestin therapy had a greater risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) than women receiving placebo. Observational studies have previously shown a reduced risk of CHD in hormone users. Hernan et al. used the NHS observational data to emulate the design and analysis of the WHI randomized trial. Their findings suggest that the differences between the Women's Health Initiative and the Nurses' Health Study ITT estimates can be largely explained by differences in the postmenopausal time distribution and duration of follow-up.

## Reaction

This is a good paper that found an explination for the discrepancies between the estimates using different data. Overall, the explination is convincing. It shows the importance of controling for coufounding even in randomized experiments.

## Questions for discussion
1. What is the best way to control for coufounding even in randomized experiments? How to make sure we have sufficiently control for coufounding?
2. Will the use of causal inference methods in this study improve the robustness of the conclusions?
